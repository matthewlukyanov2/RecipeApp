Recipe App by Matthew Lukyanov

I have designed a Recipe App built with React, Node express, and MongoDB. The applications allows for users to manage recipes,
creating recipes, updating, fetching and deleting recipes, all saved to my Mongo database. Each recipe form includes a title, ingredients,
instructions, cooking times and an optional image input url.

The features include creating a recipe - Allows users to add a new recipe by filling out a form with all stated above.
Editing a recipe - Allows users to update any recipe with new information to alter any previously made recipes.
Recipes display - All the recipes are displayed in a list like format fetched from MongoDB.
Deleting a recipe - Allows users to delete any recipe they wish from the database.

To know how to interact with my app fully, you can check out the user guide.
